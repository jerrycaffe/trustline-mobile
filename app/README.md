## 📘 About the Project

Sexual and gender-based violence remains a widespread and often underreported issue in tertiary
institutions. **Trustline** aims to close this gap by providing a **confidential**, **accessible**,
and **trustworthy digital platform** where victims, witnesses, or concerned individuals can report
incidents without fear of stigma or retaliation.

Trustline isn't just a tech solution — it's a digital shield and support system.
